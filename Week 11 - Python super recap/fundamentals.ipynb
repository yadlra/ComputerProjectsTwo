    "\n",
    "A variable in programming is a named storage location that can hold a value. Think of it like a labeled box where you can store information, and you can use the label to access that information later.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are named storage locations in memory that hold data values. When a variable is created, the computer allocates a specific amount of memory to store its value. This allocation is managed by the system, and the variable serves as a reference to this memory location. Understanding this helps in grasping how data is manipulated and managed in a computer.\n",

    "    Stores the Object: The value is stored in the allocated memory.\n",
