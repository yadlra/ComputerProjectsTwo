    "     What is a Variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable in programming is a named storage location that can hold a value. Think of it like a labeled box where you can store information, and you can use the label to access that information later.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are named storage locations in memory that hold data values. When a variable is created, the computer allocates a specific amount of memory to store its value. This allocation is managed by the system, and the variable serves as a reference to this memory location. Understanding this helps in grasping how data is manipulated and managed in a computer.\n",

    "Here, x is the variable, and 10 is the value assigned to it. Python dynamically determines the type of the variable based on the value assigned.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Memory Allocation in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, memory management is handled by the Python Memory Manager, which is responsible for allocating and deallocating memory to various objects. This process is abstracted away from the programmer, meaning you don't need to manually manage memory allocation as you would in languages like C or C++.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python uses several components to manage memory:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stack Memory: Used for static memory allocation, which includes primitive variables and function calls.\n",
    "- Heap Memory: Used for dynamic memory allocation, where all the objects and data structures (e.g., lists, dictionaries) are stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's memory manager uses a private heap containing all Python objects and data structures. The management of this private heap is ensured internally by the Python memory manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How Python Allocates Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "- Object Creation: When you create an object, Python allocates space on the heap for the object.\n",
    "- Reference Counting: Python keeps track of the number of references to each object in memory. When an object's reference count drops to zero, it means the object is no longer needed, and Python's garbage collector reclaims that memory.\n",
    "- Garbage Collection: Python has an automatic garbage collection mechanism that looks for objects that are no longer referenced and deallocates their memory to free up space.\n",
    "\n",
    "####Â Memory Addresses\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create a variable, Python creates an object in memory, and the variable name references that memory location. You can use the id() function to retrieve the memory address of an object.\n",
