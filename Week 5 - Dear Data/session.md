## Exploring Data through Art

Today, we're going to transform the way you see and understand data. By the end of our session, you'll not only have a new perspective on the data that surrounds us but also how it can be creatively visualized in an artistic and personal manner. We're going to collect, analyze, and transform our everyday data into something unique - a data collage that tells a story about you.

### Understanding Data

* Introduction to [Dear Data](http://www.dear-data.com/theproject)

It's a brilliant example of how data can be personal and expressive.

* What is Data? 

Let's chat about what data is. 
Think beyond numbers and graphs; think about the emotions you feel throughout the day, the music you listen to, or even the colors you wear. This discussion will help you start to see the data in your daily life.

### Collecting your Data

* We'll dive straight into choosing a personal topic that you can observe and collect data on during our class today. 

These are some suggestions: 
- like the plants around our school, 
- the music you've listened to recently, 
- your favorite places on campus, 
- or the anime characters you've encountered this week. 

These topics are designed to be engaging and something you can easily relate to or observe in your everyday life or right now.

* **Planning Your Collection** 

Once you've picked your topic, I'll hand out a simple template to help you plan your data collection. We'll discuss what kind of data points you might look for and how to record them effectively. 

For example, if you choose plants, you could note the types of plants, their locations, and any particular characteristics. 

If you're focusing on music, consider the genres, artists, or even the emotions the songs evoke.

* **Kickstarting Your Data Collection**

Now, let's start collecting your data! 

You don't have to go far; you can begin by using your memories of today or the past few days, or even by observing your immediate surroundings. 

For those of you focusing on plants, take a look out the window or remember the plants you've seen on your way to class. 

If you're cataloging music, think about the songs you've listened to today or this week. 

Anime, sci-fi enthusiasts can jot down the shows or characters they've recently enjoyed, and those exploring favorite places can reflect on spots they love around the campus or why they hold significance. 

This real-time approach will sharpen your observation skills and help you think creatively about how to represent this data.

### Creating your Data Collage

* **Visualizing Data**

After collecting your data, it's time to get creative! 

These are some different ways to visually represent your data, inspired by "Dear Data" and beyond.

* **Brainstorming and Sketching**

With pencils and paper, you'll start brainstorming and sketching your visualization. 

***Think about the story you want to tell with your data.***

* **Crafting A Collage**

The beginning:

Once you have finalised yor drawing, we will display our works. 


As we continue, in the next weeks we will bring our sketches together and create a collage that represents your data(s). 

This is where you get to experiment and express yourself creatively.
