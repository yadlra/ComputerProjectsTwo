# Cellular Automata with C++

This guide is designed to introduce you to C++ programming by creating a cellular automaton. 

Cellular automata are computational models used to simulate complex systems and patterns from simple rules. 

This guide will help you build your own cellular automaton program from scratch.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of programming concepts such as variables, loops, and functions. You already have it!! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
- A C++ development environment, including a compiler and a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

## Setting up your environment

- **Install a C++ Compiler**: Ensure you have a C++ compiler like GCC (G++) for Linux or MinGW for Windows. 
- macOS users can install Xcode Command Line Tools by running `xcode-select --install` in the terminal.
- **Open your editor**

## Step 1: Running a Cellular Automaton Program

- **Open C++ File**: Open the file `automata1.cpp`.

- **Compile your programme**: Use your development environment or the command line to compile the program. If using the command line, navigate to your project directory and compile with:
  
  ```sh
  g++ -std=c++11 automata1.cpp -o automata1
  ```
  
- **Run your programme**: 

```
./automata1
```

## Additional Exercises


   - What happens if you change the number of cell rows and number of generations? Try it out!
   - why does it look like that?
   - OPTIONAL: Implement different rules: Experiment with your cellular automaton by implementing different rules (like Rule 90 or Rule 110) and observe the patterns that emerge.
